This script should prepare a host for an initial run of puppet. 
It's made to be run on hosts with absolutely no configuration.

Usage: prime vili.example.com LD@P_S3cr3t

It assumes that there is an LDAP Server "out there" that may be found with a SRV record for one of:

  _ldap._ssl.example.com
  _ldap._tls.example.com
  _ldap._tcp.example.com

(example.com should be replaced by your domain)

It also assumes there is a cn=vili,ou=Hosts,dc=example,dc=com distinguished name on those LDAP servers with
a simpleSecurityObject objectclass, and the userPassword for the DN is LD@P_S3cr3t.

Basically, it's a a way of passing your host a LDAP password it can use for secure authentication/authorization
actions in a non-secure network.

It "primes" your host for your infrastructure.

It will:

1) Set the hostname on the host to the first argument (vili.example.com)
